# Project Name: Homework 13- Fitness Tracker

### Description of the Project: 

The Fitness Tracker is an application that allows the user to view, create and track their daily workouts. It will log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. It tracks the name, type, weight, sets, reps and duration of a exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, it will track the distance traveled.  The application uses a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema. 

### Installation instructions: 

Begin installation of the application by creating a package.json file by running ‘npm init -y’ at the terminal command line. Install the following npm packages: Express, Morgan and Mongoose by entering ‘npm install express –save’, ‘npm install morgan --save’ and ‘npm install mongoose –save’, respectively. The application is then ready to use.

### Usage instructions: 

Open the server.js file and type ‘node server.js’ in the terminal command line. A response will appear in the command line indicating the Server is listening on http://localhost:3000. Open a web browser and enter ‘localhost:3000’ in the address line and type the Enter key. A page will appear with the Fitness tracker dashboard.
